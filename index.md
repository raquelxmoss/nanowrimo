NaNoWriMo 2015	

Vi watched Lynn in the mirror as her younger sister perched on the edge of the bed, skirt hoisted above her knees and legs splayed. A slim, pale hand fiddled as Lynn wound her stocking up her left leg. 

"That's not very ladylike, Lynn", scolded Vi. Lynn cast Vi a dubious glance and continued to wind the stocking. Vi sighed and switched her gaze back to her own dark-eyed face. Her hair was half-done, the thick black curls escaping the pins that Vi had so determinedly set only ten minutes ago. Her pale skin was rather washed-out by the pale peach chiffon dress she wore, but Vi's love for peach transcended good fashion sense. Besides, Leo had said that he liked the dress when she had worn it to the Spring dance in October.

A gentle knock at the door made the two sisters look up, and Lynn swept her now stockinged legs underneath her. Graham, the girls' older brother, poked his head around the door before the rest of him followed. 

"Nearly ready?" he asked quietly, settling himself into Vi's sewing chair beneath the window. 

"Vi's still got to finish her hair," replied Lynn, "Here, I'll help," she added to Vi. "The back has gone all crooked."

Vi dropped her hands to her lap and let Lynn's nimbler fingers take over. She twisted the ring she wore around her little finger in agitation before forcing herself to be still. 

Glancing at Graham, she smirked at the incongruous sight of her bulky and besuited elder brother atop her frilled and dainty sewing seat. 

"Would you like some embroidery to do, Graham?" she asked sweetly. "I've a half-finished bookmark that could use some attention, and I'm sure you're just the person to do it."

Graham didn't take the bait, staring at Vi blandly. Graham was a serious young man, and his sisters' barbed wits almost always bounced off him. Even so, he seemed grumpier than usual. 

"Father says you're not to dance with the Michelson boy tonight, Vi," said Graham sternly, and Vi gave her ring another twitch. "If he asks, you're to say your dance card's full."

Vi flashed at this, rising sharply from her seat to face Graham and disturbing Lynn's pinning in the process. 

"_The Michelson boy_? I'm to tell him my dance card's full!?" she screeched, incredulously. "Graham! You know full well that Leo will never believe that. My dance card is never full! My dance card is only ever not empty if Leo himself, or my _dearest_ brother takes pity on me! Am I to dance with you all night? Winsome certainly won't like that, and I'll not have her ire on me Graham Moss!"

"Keep your voice down, Vi" was Graham's quiet, and measured reply. He looked pityingly at his outraged sister. Her curls were mussed again, and her peach gown quivered. 

"I'm sorry, Vi. I have to obey father. And... Vi, I know you don't want to hear it, but I think our parents are right. You should end this... whatever it is that you have going with Leo, you should end it now. Our parents are never going to let you marry him, and I don't think his parents are too keen on the match either."

Vi turned away from Graham and sat again, hands now feverishly twisting the ring on her finger. It was a tiny ring, plain gilt, with no stone or inscription. She wore it on the little finger of her right hand. Leo had given it to her the previous month, after a quiet stroll through the town's cemetary. She hadn't taken it off since.

Lynn took up her pinning again, and the trio sat in pregnant silence until the curls were finally tamed.

______________________________________________________________________

It was a short walk to the town hall -- to the end of the lane, and then left down the main street. The hall was slightly beyond the shops, nestled up against the bush. 

The siblings' mood persisted through their walk. Graham, silent and contemplative, kept a determined and righteous Vi company. She marched in her peach satin shoes as though to a dirge. Lynn walked ahead of the others, humming to herself and cutting an unwieldy path in her green gown. Lynn seemed always off in her own world.

As they reached the post office, two figures appeared in the twilight. 

"Hullo Graham, it's good to see you," said a cheerful voice as they approached. It was David, Graham's classmate, and Winsome, his sister. Graham's seriousness wavered as he and David shook hands. Winsome fell into step between Graham and Vi, and Vi noticed Winsome's hand twine with Graham's. 

"How are you, Vi?" asked Winsome. "You look lovely! I've always adored that dress" she added, before Vi could answer. Vi broke her determined chain of thought to smile at Winsome.

"Thank you, Winsome. I'm alright. Spent the morning with the horses. Lucy was itching to get out, so we rode the boundary. How are you?"

Vi tuned out at Winsome chattered about her day. Winsome was a lovely girl, with a garrulous spirit, but Vi's mood was set for the evening, and could not be distracted by Winsome's good nature. Thankfully, Vi only had to reply with an 'mmm' every so often to keep Winsome going. Idly, Vi wondered what Winsome saw in Graham, and concluded that it was probably his laconic nature; all the better for Winsome to chatter sweetly.

As they walked, the boys talked seriously about the high school rugby team's chances in the regional competition that year. As they neared the hall, more of the town's youth joined their path, and soon Lynn was chatting gaily to her friends and casting sidelong looks at the rest of the rugby team. Graham affected not to notice, but Vi knew that Graham would prevent Lynn's dance card from filling entirely with halfbacks. 

Soon, Vi was alone in the crowd. Graham, Winsome, and David had drifted to the hall's front porch, and Lynn's green satin gown disappeared into mass. Vi went to stand under the oak tree that sat to the side of the hall. It was nearly dark, and the summer night was warm. She leaned her back carefully against the tree, and looked up at Mt Ruapehu, silhouetted against the deep purple sky. She didn't have to wait long. 

Leo approched her alone; He hadn't lingered to talk in the crowd. Vi untwisted her still-anxious hands and held them both out for Leo to take. He did so, and kissed her gently on the forehead. As he did, Vi felt some of the tension leave her shoulders, and she breathed out audibly.

"I missed you," he said by way of greeting. "I saw you out on Lucy today, did you run the whole boundary?" 

"Yes," Vi replied, "and a good thing too. I found a hole in the fence near the Foster's place. Graham had to go out and patch it before the dance."

"Is that why he's so grumpy?" Asked Leo.

Vi looked at him askance. 

"I saw him on my way here," Leo explained. "Looked like he'd been forced to swallow a rat."

"Ah, well as to that..." Vi trailed off. For all her determination and nervous planning as she and her siblings had walked to the dance, she hadn't figured out how to broach the subject with Leo. Holding his large, warm hands, and gazing up into his bright blue eyes, she steeled herself anew. 

A rustle in the darkness interrupted them before Vi could speak. 

"Vi," said a voice, warningly. It was Graham. "Vi, you know you can't do this."

Vi turned sharply. 

"Ten minutes, Graham. Give me ten minutes," she said, acidly. Graham hesitated.

"What's going on?" Asked Leo, looking between Vi and Graham. Neither sibling answered. 

"Ten minutes," Vi said again, this time a note of pleading in her voice.

Graham grunted an assent and slowly, reluctantly retreated to the hall's porch. 

"Vi, what on earth is going on?" Leo asked. Vi squeezed his hands and faced him determindely. 

"Leo, let's get married," she said firmly.

Leo stared blankly back at her, bewildered.

"You're eighteen, and I will be next week," Vi went on. "You've given me a ring, I mean, we've practically been engaged for months now. Why wait? Let's do it."

"Vi, what on earth are you talking about?" Leo removed his hands from hers and ran then through his sandy-blond hair. "What's the hurry? This isn't how things are meant to go. I mean, you're still in school! I'm still an apprentice! I can't support a family yet. Maybe in a year, when Mr Roberts releases me, we can go and work on a farm together, but right now it's impossible! Why are you in such a hurry, Vi? I... are you pregnant?"

Vi bristled at that. "Pregnant?" she hissed. "You know full well that there's no way that I could be pregnant! We haven't..."

"I know, I know, Vi," Leo said, placatingly. "But, I mean...maybe you had... with someone else?"

It was entirely the wrong thing to say. Vi reached up and slapped Leo hard across the face. 

"Is that what you think of me? You think that I'm like Sissy Danbridge, spreading my legs for the rugby team? Gracious, perhaps I should. Form an orderly queue, gents!"

"Hush, hush. Vi! I didn't really think that. I just... this doesn't make any sense. Why do you want to rush into a marriage?" Leo was getting desperate. He wasn't good with words when emotions were high.

"Because I love you, Leo. I love you, and I don't want to wait. I'd have thought you would feel the same too."

"Vi, I do love you. And I want to marry you, of course. In a year, when we're ready. Please, Vi. One year."

Vi's lip quivered. 

Another voice spoke. "It's not going to happen, Leo," Graham had reappeared and his hesitation was gone. "Come on Vi. Let's go in."

"Vi, why? Please tell me what's going on." Leo was distraught, and confused. 

"Our father won't allow you two to marry," said Graham, quietly. "You're Catholic, Leo. Vivienne will marry a Protestant."

"He's a Catholic, Graham. He's not a Martian!" Vi's rage had bubbled anew.

Leo exhaled sharply and clenched his fists. He turned to go. Vi stumbled towards him but Graham had taken ahold of her wrist and she was trapped. 

"Leo!" she cried, anguished.

Leo stalked off into the darkness, not looking back.

"Let's go in, Vi," repeated Graham quietly, tugging her along. Vi choked and followed reluctantly.

______________________________________________________________________

The Town Hall was decorated for the dance, and taffeta ribbons brushed Graham's hair as he led Vi deep into the crowd. She followed with ill grace and grimaced as Graham sat her down in the corner of the room. 

"Try to enjoy the dance, Vi," Graham advised. Winsome appeared and sat down next to Graham, tapping her foot to the music and keeping up a steady flow of conversation. 

Vi stared blankly out at the dancers, barely hearing the music and chewing her lip moodily. She knew she hadn't done a good job of explaining her thoughts to Leo, but she hadn't wanted to bring up the elephant in the room -- neither her parents nor Leo's wanted them to marry, and the two of them were going to have to make a decision soon as to whether they would defy their parents or obey them.

Leo was wrong, Vi thought; it would make no difference whether they faced the issue when Leo was done with his apprenticeship. Their parents were set in their ways, and they wouldn't change their minds. Leo and Vi needed to find the courage to be bold and act now. Vi didn't want to think about the alternative. 

Vi stewed, foot tapping irritably, out-of-time with the music. Graham eventually drifted away, an enthusiastic Winsome leading him to dance. Vi watched them in a detached sort of way. Graham wasn't the most graceful dancer, but with Winsome in his arms he did seem truly happy. The seriousness that usually hung on him like a damp coat seemed lifted as he danced with Winsome.

Unable to take the gaiety around her any more, Vi stood sharply and wove her way to the porch, unnoticed. The porch was crowded with happy young folk taking in the cool air of the spring evening. Vi edged around them and out towards the trees. She sat down with her back to the tree under which she had stood an hour ago, confronting Leo. Her taffeta dress crumpled beneath her and caught flecks of bark from the twig she twirled around her fingers.

After a few minutes, a gaggle of girls on the porch noticed Vi. 

"Nice dress, Vivienne!" one of them called, "Just as nice as when you wore it to the last dance!"

The girls burst into gales of laughter. Vi was too empty of emotion to care, and didn't respond. The taunts continued.

"Full dance card then, Viv?" asked Sissy Danbridge, mockingly. "I didn't realise the trees were available to waltz!"

At that, Vi glanced up angrily, but was spared from answering by the appearance of Graham beside her.

"Christ, Graham," she muttered, "You're like my shadow tonight."

"Come and dance with me, Vi," he cajoled.

"No. I'm not in the ... I just can't dance tonight, Graham. Go and take another turn with Winsome. I'll be fine."

"Trees and her dear brother," came a cackle from the porch, "Vivienne sure is popular this evening!"

Vi ignored the girls. _Airheads_ she thought.

"Go, Graham. I'll wait for you and Lynn on the bench outside the post office, alright? Come and collect me on your way home."

She left, allowing no further argument, marching into the night in her peach satin shoes.


- Leo comes to Vi's window after the dance and they try to talk it out. Leo resolves to ask his father's permission, but father turns him down. Leo acquiesces, Vi calls him a coward and cries.
- As Leo's engagement to a Nice Catholic Girl is announced, Vi leaves for Wellington and dental nursery.

Fiona and Megan clutched their warm cups of jasmine tea gratefully, easing the chill of the Wellington wind. Raquel smirked at them, amused, and sipped her own tea.

"Have you heard from Mum recently?" Fi asked Meg.

"Last I heard she was on holiday again," replied Meg. "Her and Leo were driving to Ohakune."

"They came down to Wellington the other week," added Raquel, "No warning at all, she just sent me a text asking if I was in town and said she wanted to have lunch. I had no idea Leo was with her until we got to lunch and there he was."

"She did the same thing to me," nodded Fi, "I got a text from her '_Meet me in 20 minutes for lunch_'. I was expected to just drop everything and go to lunch. It was a busy day, too. I don't know why she couldn't have given me a day's warning, I would have arranged for someone else to look after the desk."

"Well, you know what mum's like," sighed Meg, "It's all about her all the time"

"Yep," agreed Fi. 

"What's up with her and Leo? Are they still married?" Raquel couldn't figure out what the situation was.

"Well they have to be, don't they? Catholics and all that." Meg said.

"Oh yes, they're definitely still married. They can't live together though, mum was bored out of her brain there," added Fi.

"Right, but they still go on holiday together? Frequently?" Raquel asked.

"It's not like they've got anything better to do," replied Meg, sarcasically. 

"She looks after him when he's sick, too," said Fi. "She went down to Tauranga and stayed with him after he had his big heart operation. Oh! God!" Fi slapped the table, jostling the teas. "I forgot to tell you about what mum did while Leo was in hospital."

"What happened?" asked Meg

"Well," replied Fi, "she rang me up while Leo was in hospital. He had to stay in there for quite a while because he wasn't healing very well. So mum was staying in his house, looking after things there. She was moaning to me about the Leo's cat -- the poor thing probably just was not conforming to her agenda, you know -- and so then she says "So I took the cat to the vet and got it put down,"" 

Raquel and Meg looked at each other and burst into incredulous laughter. The story was too absurd for any other reaction. 

"Was the cat sick?" asked Raquel.

"No!" answered Fi, "No, the cat was perfectly fine, it was just old!"

"Seriously?" asked Meg, "She put the cat down because it was old? Did she ask Leo?"

"No, she didn't even tell him! So poor Leo gets home after his drastic heart surgery -- which, you know, no small thing -- and his bloody cat is gone!"

"Christ, poor Leo," said Meg, wiping away tears of laughter. 

"God, I know -- can you imagine?" Fi was still laughing, too "I can't believe she would do that... well, I can. She's on the phone with me saying 'Oh you know, the cat's old and scuzzy. Better pack it in now' " 

"Shit, Leo had better not get old and scuzzy then," said Raquel, rolling her eyes. The trio burst into laughter again.

"Yeah, the minute you're no longer useful, you're out, pack your bags!" exclaimed Fi. 

"She did the same thing when I was five, you know?" said Meg. "The cat was getting on, so Mum had obviously told Dad to get rid of it, and he'd put the cat in a cardboard box and chloroformed the poor thing. So later that night, Mum had friends over for a dinner party, and we kids were sent to the garage to play, and I was playing around and came across this cardboard box. Opened up the box, and there's my cat, you know-- " Meg rolled back her eyes and stuck out her tongue, "So I picked the cat up out of the box and ran into the house, crying. Went straight into the dining room and sat the cat on the table in the middle of dinner, crying about how the cat was sick and we had to take him to the vet."

The women laughed and choked down their tea. 

"My grandmother, the serial cat-killer," said Raquel.
